        <h1> All About Caroline </h1>
        <h2> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</h2>
        <h3> Hi, my name is Caroline Hana. I am 18, and I was born in Phoenix, Arizona!</h3>
        <h4 style>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</h4>

        <p>My favorite color is purple. I love pizza and traveling. I have two bothers and one
            sister. I also have a doggy and his name is Theo. I love video games and watching anime in my free time. I
            have currently been playing Valorant, Minecraft, and Left 4 Dead 2. An anime I have been watching recently
            is My Hero Academia, but I want to start watching something new. I have a bestfriend and her name is Lerissa
            and she's cool I guess. I was supposed to go to Sacramento State University, but decided I didn't want to be
            in student debt from nursing. So I dropped out and I am now doing CodeStack Academy! We have this pretty
            cool teacher his name is Ken!! We also have two cool TAs named Danny, and Scott!! I am glad that I made my
            career change and I have also made some pretty cool new freinds :)) </p>
